## 🐍 Python Challenge #10 — Palindrome Check
# Overview

In this challenge, you’ll write a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome.

A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards after normalization.
The goal isn’t just correctness—it’s handling input safely and predictably.

This challenge reinforces string manipulation, normalization, and defensive programming.
