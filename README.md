## 🐍 Python Challenge #10 — Palindrome Check
# Overview

In this challenge, you’ll write a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome.

A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards after normalization.
The goal isn’t just correctness—it’s handling input safely and predictably.

This challenge reinforces string manipulation, normalization, and defensive programming.

# 🧠 The Challenge

Write a function that determines whether a string is a palindrome.

---

# ✅ Rules

The input must be a string

Ignore:

Spaces

Letter casing

Return:

True if the string is a palindrome

False otherwise

Raise a TypeError for invalid input

---

# 💡 Hints

Normalize the string before checking

A reversed string comparison works well after cleanup

Decide explicitly what should and should not be ignored

---

# 🎯 What This Challenge Teaches

String normalization

Defensive input validation

Boolean logic

Writing predictable, testable functions

---

# 🚀 Bonus Ideas

Ignore punctuation (e.g. commas, periods)

Support Unicode characters

Solve without reversing the string

Check multiple strings at once
